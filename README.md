### Summary

Application written in NodeJS because I primarily work in Ruby/JavaScript and haven't used Python in about a year.

`src` - contains all application code
`input` - input file location
`output` - output file location
`insight_testsuite` - all functional tests for application
`test` - unit tests for application

### Goals of Application

1. Parse files without blowing up your computer (memory)
2. Speed
3. Error handling for bad data
4. Create 'endpoints' for you to grab information
